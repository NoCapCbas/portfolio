**Project Overview:**
webStash is a simple tool to bookmark and organize your favorite websites.

## Objectives

1. Develop a user-friendly tool that allows users to save, organize, and manage bookmarks.
2. Learn more about Python, Docker, and integrating cloud services like Cloudflare Tunnels.

## MVP Features

1. **Bookmark and organize sites:**

- Users can add, edit, and delete bookmarks.
- Organize bookmarks with tags or folders.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend: Alpine.js, TailwindCSS
- Database: SQLite
- Deployment: Docker, Cloudflare Tunnels

I used Alpine.js and TailwindCSS for the frontend for a lightweight and flexible UI. Python (FastAPI) powers the backend for rapid development and easy API creation. SQLite is used for simple, file-based storage. Docker and Cloudflare Tunnels make deployment and secure remote access straightforward.

## Things I Learned building this project

- How to build a Python backend with FastAPI.
- How to integrate SQLite for persistent storage.
- How to containerize an app with Docker.
- How to expose local services securely using Cloudflare Tunnels.

## Future Development

- Add user authentication and sharing features.
- Implement bookmark import/export.
- Add browser extension support.
 Add more features like checking if the site is up, checking if the site is down, etc.
