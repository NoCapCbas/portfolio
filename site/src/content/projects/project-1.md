**Project Overview:**
Site Ping is a tool that helps you ping a site and get the html response.

## Objectives

1. Develop a user-friendly tool that allows users to ping a site and get the html response.
2. Learn more about golang and alpine.js.

## MVP Features

1. **Ping a site and get the html response:**

- Users can ping a site and get the html response.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Golang
- Frontend: Alpine.js, Tailwind

I used alpine.js for the frontend because it's a lightweight framework that's easy to use and it's easy to integrate with tailwind. Also has minimal setup since this is a toy project. And used golang for backend to learn more about the language.

## Things I Learned building this project

- How to build golang backend.
- How to embed html in golang application.
- How to decrease server load by rate limiting all users in using golang.

## Future Development

- Add api support for pinging a site and getting the html response.
- Add more features like checking if the site is up, checking if the site is down, etc.
